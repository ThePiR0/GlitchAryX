# 👾 Yo, I’m ThePiR0

Welcome to the chaos. I’m Aaryan—a CSE student who's out here breaking code, bending logic, and occasionally making things that actually work. I breathe in JavaScript and exhale bugs, but somehow it all comes together in the end.

## ⚙️ What I’m Cooking Up
- 🌐 **Web Dev Wizardry** – Blacked-out UIs, glowing neon, React + Tailwind on blast. If it doesn’t look futuristic, I don’t want it.
- 📱 **Android Shenanigans** – Flutter + caffeine = cross-platform madness.
- 🤖 **AI Nerd Stuff** – Playing around with CNNs, image gen, and lowkey building my HUD(it's fire trust me).
- 🧠 **Writing Tech Stuff** – Docs that don’t suck. I explain things the way I wish someone explained it to me.

## 🔥 Stuff I’ve Built (and didn’t rage delete)
- 🌌 **Flappy Bird Clone** – A JavaScript-based fake clone of the classic.
- 📱 **Flutter App** – Still vibing in dev mode but it’s clean af.
- 🖥 **Simon Says Game** – Because I was bored and had a mid-life crisis at 2 AM.

## 🧪 Currently Grinding
Building wild projects during college vacays. From a Virtual Lost & Found board to a College Life Manager and an AI clone of myself—if it’s overkill, I’m doing it.

Also trying not to fry my laptop or my brain. So far, it’s going well. Ish.(You have been warned....)
